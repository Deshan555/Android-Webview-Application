# Android Webview Application

To create an Android app using an android-webview, you will need to use Android Studio and have some basic knowledge of programming in Java and XML. Here are the general steps you will need to follow:

- Download and install Android Studio on your computer.
- Open Android Studio and create a new project by clicking on "File" > "New" > "New Project".
- In the "Select a Project Template" window, select "Empty Activity" and click "Next".
- In the "Configure your project" window, give your project a name and package name and click "Finish".
- In the "Project" pane on the left side of the screen, navigate to the "app" > "res" > "layout" folder and open "activity_main.xml". This is where you will design the layout of your app.
- To add a webview to your layout, you can add the following code to the xml file:

```bash
  <
    WebView 
    android:id="@+id/webview"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
  />
```

- In the "Project" pane, navigate to the "app" > "java" > "com.yourpackage" > "MainActivity.java" file and add the following code to load a website in the webview:

```bash
WebView webView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webview);
webView.loadUrl("https://www.example.com");
```

- Now you have to add internet permission in your AndroidManifest.xml file, add the following code:

```bash
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

- Finally, you can run the app on an emulator or an actual Android device by clicking the "Run" button in the top right corner of the screen.

⚠️ Note: These are the basic steps for creating an app using an android-webview, you can also add other functionality like enabling javascript, adding progressbar or add other features.
